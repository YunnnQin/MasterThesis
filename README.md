# MasterThesis-Cross-species comparison of conserved neuron cell types important in spatial processing
Codes contain three parts:
1. Raw RNA-seq data read alignment and mapping: pig_mouse_int.Rmd, pig_mouse_int.Rmd.
2. Data analysis within species: human_process.Rmd, pig_process.Rmd, mouse_process.Rmd
3. Data integration across species: human_mouse_int.Rmd, pig_human_int.Rmd, pig_mouse_int.Rmd
